# React Router Vending Machine Exercise

* A VendingMachine component, which shows a page with a list of snacks that you can get from the vending machine.
  
* At least three different snack components, each one corresponding to a vending machine snack.
  
* By clicking on an item in the VendingMachine you can view one of things inside of the machine. Clicking should update the URL and show the snack that you’ve clicked on.
From each snack component, you should be able to go back to the main VendingMachine component.

* Add a second copy of the links to a site-wide navigation bar. This should show
  
up at the top of each page, and should have some style to highlight the active link.

Here’s an example of what this might look like.
